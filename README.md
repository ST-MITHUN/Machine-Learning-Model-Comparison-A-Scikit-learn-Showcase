# Machine-Learning-Model-Comparison-A-Scikit-learn-Showcase
This repository presents a comparative study of various machine learning algorithms implemented with scikit-learn. It covers both supervised (k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree) and unsupervised (k-Means Clustering) learning techniques.
